  We opt to use a quintic iteration whose coefficients are selected to maximize
  the slope at zero. For the purpose of minimizing steps, it turns out to be
  empirically effective to keep increasing the slope at zero even beyond the
  point where the iteration no longer converges all the way to one everywhere
  on the interval. This iteration therefore does not produce UV^T but rather
  something like US'V^T where S' is diagonal with S_{ii}' ~ Uniform(0.5, 1.5),
  which turns out not to hurt model performance at all relative to UV^T, where
  USV^T = G is the SVD.

  Args:
    x: A matrix to orthogonalize.
    ns_coeffs: Coefficients for the Newton-schulz iterators.
      Must have shape (n, 3) where n is the number of iterations.
    ns_steps: Number of Newton-schulz iterations.
