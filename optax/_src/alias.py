  """The DPSGD optimiser.

  Differential privacy is a standard for privacy guarantees of algorithms
  learning from aggregate databases including potentially sensitive information.
  DPSGD offers protection against a strong adversary with full knowledge of the
  training mechanism and access to the modelâ€™s parameters.

  WARNING: This `GradientTransformation` expects input updates to have a batch
  dimension on the 0th axis. That is, this function expects per-example
  gradients as input (which are easy to obtain in JAX using `jax.vmap`).

  Args:
    learning_rate: this is a fixed global scaling factor.
    l2_norm_clip: maximum L2 norm of the per-example gradients.
    noise_multiplier: ratio of standard deviation to the clipping norm.
    seed: initial seed used for the jax.random.PRNGKey
    momentum: (default `None`), the `decay` rate used by the momentum term,
      when it is set to `None`, then momentum is not used at all.
    nesterov (default `False`): whether nesterov momentum is used.

  Returns:
    A `GradientTransformation`.
