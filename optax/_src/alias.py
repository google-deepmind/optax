  """The AdaBelief optimizer.

  AdaBelief is an adaptive learning rate optimizer that focuses on fast
  convergence, generalization, and stability. It adapts the step size depending
  on its "belief" in the gradient direction â€” the optimizer adaptively scales
  the step size by the difference between the predicted and observed gradients.
  AdaBelief is a modified version of Adam and contains the same number of
  parameters.

  r"""The Adam optimizer.

  Adam is an SGD variant with gradient scaling adaptation. The scaling
  used for each parameter is computed from estimates of first and second-order
  moments of the gradients (using suitable exponential moving averages).

  Let :math:`\alpha_t` represent the learning rate and :math:`\beta_1, \beta_2`,
  :math:`\varepsilon`, :math:`\bar{\varepsilon}` represent the arguments
  ``b1``, ``b2``, ``eps`` and ``eps_root`` respectievly. The learning rate is
  indexed by :math:`t` since the learning rate may also be provided by a
  schedule function.

  The ``init`` function of this optimizer initializes an internal state
  :math:`S_0 := (m_0, v_0) = (0, 0)`, representing initial estimates for the
  first and second moments. In practice these values are stored as pytrees
  containing all zeros, with the same shape as the model updates.
  At step :math:`t`, the ``update`` function of this optimizer takes as
  arguments the incoming gradients :math:`g_t` and optimizer state :math:`S_t`
  and computes updates :math:`u_t` and new state :math:`S_{t+1}`. Thus, for
  :math:`t > 0`, we have,

  .. math::

    \begin{align*}
      m_t &\leftarrow \beta_1 \cdot m_{t-1} + (1-\beta_1) \cdot g_t \\
      v_t &\leftarrow \beta_2 \cdot v_{t-1} + (1-\beta_2) \cdot {g_t}^2 \\
      \hat{m}_t &\leftarrow m_t / {(1-\beta_1^t)} \\

      u_t &\leftarrow \alpha_t \cdot \hat{m}_t / \left({\sqrt{\hat{v}_t +
      \bar{\varepsilon}} + \varepsilon} \right)\\
      S_t &\leftarrow (m_t, v_t).
    \end{align*}

  With the keyword argument `nesterov=True`, the optimizer uses Nesterov
  momentum, replacing the above :math:`\hat{m}_t` with

  .. math::
      \hat{m}_t \leftarrow
        \beta_1 m_t / {(1-\beta_1^{t+1})} + (1 - \beta_1) g_t / {(1-\beta_1^t)}.

  r"""A flexible RMSProp optimizer.

  RMSProp is an SGD variant with learning rate adaptation. The `learning_rate`
  used for each weight is scaled by a suitable estimate of the magnitude of the
  gradients on previous steps. Several variants of RMSProp can be found
  in the literature. This alias provides an easy to configure RMSProp
  optimizer that can be used to switch between several of these variants.

  ..warning::
    PyTorch and optax's RMSprop implementations differ and could impact
    performance. In the denominator, optax uses :math:`$\sqrt{v + \epsilon}$`
    whereas PyTorch uses :math:`$\sqrt{v} + \epsilon$`. See
    https://github.com/google-deepmind/optax/issues/532 for more detail.
