  This function can be used for binary or multiclass classification (where each

  Because this function is overloaded, please ensure your `logits` and `labels`

  in {0, 1}), ensure your `logits` correspond to class 1 only. If you're
  passing in per-class target probabilities or one-hot `labels`, please ensure
  your `logits` are also multiclass. Be particularly careful if you're relying
  on implicit broadcasting to reshape `logits` or `labels`.

  The PolyLoss is a loss function that decomposes commonly

  cross-entropy loss and focal loss in the bases of :math:`(1 âˆ’ P_t)^j`.

  .. math::
    L_{Poly} = \sum_1^\infty \alpha_j \cdot (1 - P_t)^j \\
    L_{Poly-N} = (\epsilon_1 + 1) \cdot (1 - P_t) + \ldots + \\

    - \log(P_t) + \sum_{j = 1}^N \epsilon_j \cdot (1 - P_t)^j

  This function provides a simplified version of :math:`L_{Poly-N}`
  with only the coefficient of the first polynomial term being changed.

  The CTC loss is a loss function based on log-likelihoods of the model that

  Forward probabilities returned by this function, as auxiliary results, are
  grouped into two part: blank alpha-probability and non-blank alpha
  probability. Those are defined as follows:

  .. math::
    \alpha_{\mathrm{BLANK}}(t, n) =

    \sum_{\pi_{1:t-1}} p(\pi_t = y_n | \pi_{1:t-1}, y_{1:n-1}, \cdots).

  Here, :math:`\pi` denotes the alignment sequence in the reference
  [Graves et al, 2006] that is blank-inserted representations of ``labels``.
  The return values are the logarithms of the above probabilities.
