# üõ†Ô∏è Development

We welcome contributions to Optax! Whether you have a bug report, a question,
a feature suggestion, or code to share, your input is valuable.

## How to Contribute

For most contributions, the best way to get started is to raise an issue in the
Github [issue tracker](https://github.com/deepmind/optax/issues) describing the
problem to be solved, or the idea to be worked on. This will enable some
discussion on the best way to land new features, and can also provide
opportunities for collaborations with other contributors.

Some more details on contributing code are provided in the
[CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/google-deepmind/optax/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md)
file in the source tree.

**Need ideas?** If you would like to get started with contributing to Optax, but do not know
what to start working on, check out our selection of [*good first issues*](https://github.com/google-deepmind/optax/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22).


## Improving the documentation

Documentation is key, and we're particularly happy to accept documentation improvements.

Our documentation is written in [Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/). You can
build the documentation locally as follows:

1. **Install Requirements**: `pip install .[docs]`
2. **Build the Docs**: From the `docs` folder, run:
   * `make html` (builds everything)
   * `make html-noplot` (faster, skips running examples)


### Running doctest
You can add examples illustrating how to use the functions in docstrings. For
inspiration see the `Examples:` section of the code source of `adam` in 
`optax/_src/alias.py`.

To test locally such examples, run 
`python -m doctest -v <path_to_your_file>.py`.

## Inclusion Criteria

To ensure Optax remains a focused and high-quality library, we have specific guidelines for including algorithms in the main `optax` package:

1. **Established**: Algorithms should generally be published for at least 2 years, well-cited (100+ citations), and demonstrate broad utility.
2. **Significant Improvement**: Minor modifications will be considered if they offer clear advantages over widely used methods.

If your algorithm doesn't meet the main package criteria, the {doc}`api/contrib` directory is perfect for sharing innovative work.


#### Design Documents

For more complex or involved features, we recommend starting by writing a
design document, or RFC ("Request For Comments") before spending significant
time writing code. This can provide an opportunity for other contributors to
provide input and find the best way to land new features and also provides a
reference for future users to understand how the library works.

For an example of this, see the following
[[RFC] Proposal for complex-valued optimization in Optax](https://gist.github.com/wdphy16/118aef6fb5f82c49790d7678cf87da29) authored by [Dian Wu](https://github.com/wdphy16) which led to the addition of improved [complex numbers](https://optax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/contrib.html?complex-valued-optimization#complex-valued-optimization) support in Optax.


#### Contributor License Agreement

Contributions to this project must be accompanied by a Contributor License
Agreement. You (or your employer) retain the copyright to your contribution;
this simply gives us permission to use and redistribute your contributions as
part of the project. Head over to <https://cla.developers.google.com/> to see
your current agreements on file or to sign a new one.

You generally only need to submit a CLA once, so if you've already submitted one
(even if it was for a different project), you probably don't need to do it
again.
