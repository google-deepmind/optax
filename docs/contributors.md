# Contributors

Optax welcomes contributions from the open source community. This can include
issues, bug reports, questions, design documents, pull requests, or any other
input to the project.

## How to Contribute

For most contributions, the best way to get started is to raise an issue in the
Github [issue tracker](https://github.com/deepmind/optax/issues) describing the
problem to be solved, or the idea to be worked on. This will enable some
discussion on the best way to land new features, and can also provide
opportunities for collaborations with other contributors.

Some more details on contributing code are provided in the
[CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/deepmind/optax/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)
file in the source tree.

#### Design Documents

For more complex or involved features, we recommend starting out by writing a
design document, or RFC ("Request For Comments") before spending significant
time writing code. This can provide an opportunity for other contributors to
provide input and find the best way to land new features, and also provides a
reference for future users to understand how the library works. For an example
of this, please see the following
[[RFC] Proposal for complex-valued optimization in Optax](https://gist.github.com/wdphy16/118aef6fb5f82c49790d7678cf87da29),
which lead to the addition of improved complex support in Optax.

#### Contributor License Agreement

Contributions to this project must be accompanied by a Contributor License
Agreement. You (or your employer) retain the copyright to your contribution;
this simply gives us permission to use and redistribute your contributions as
part of the project. Head over to <https://cla.developers.google.com/> to see
your current agreements on file or to sign a new one.

You generally only need to submit a CLA once, so if you've already submitted one
(even if it was for a different project), you probably don't need to do it
again.

#### Ideas for Contributions

If you would like to get started with contributing to Optax, but do not know
what to start working on, a selection of *"good first issues"* for new
contributors are given in the
[issue tracker](https://github.com/deepmind/optax/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22good+first+issue).
Ideas for good starter contributions are also welcomed.
