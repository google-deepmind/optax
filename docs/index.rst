=====
Optax
=====

Optax is a gradient processing and optimization library for JAX. It is designed
to facilitate research by providing building blocks that can be recombined in
custom ways in order to optimize parametric models such as, but not limited to,
deep neural networks.

Our goals are to

*   Provide readable, well-tested, efficient implementations of core components,
*   Improve researcher productivity by making it possible to combine low level
    ingredients into custom optimizer (or other gradient processing components).
*   Accelerate adoption of new ideas by making it easy for anyone to contribute.

We favor focusing on small composable building blocks that can be effectively
combined into custom solutions. Others may build upon these basic components
more complicated abstractions. Whenever reasonable, implementations prioritize
readability and structuring code to match standard equations, over code reuse.

Installation
------------

The latest release of Optax can be installed from
`PyPI <https://pypi.org/project/optax/>`_ using::

   pip install optax

You may also install directly from GitHub, using the following command. This
can be used to obtain the most recent version of Optax::

   pip install git+git://github.com/google-deepmind/optax.git

Note that Optax is built on top of JAX.
See `here <https://github.com/jax-ml/jax?tab=readme-ov-file#installation>`_
for instructions on installing JAX.
